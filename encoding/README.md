# Encoding

## About
This directory contains the programs for creating and merging plans.
The programs "input.lp", "action.lp", "goal.lp", and "encoding.lp" have
been taken from the github repository "https://github.com/potassco/asprilo-encodings"
and are solely used to create plans for single robots. The program "merging.lp" takes plans 
created by these programs and combines them so that a plan is created without conflicts.

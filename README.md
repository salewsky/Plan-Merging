## About
This is the repository for the plan merging project for the asprilo framework. 
The project is about combining the plans of robots so that no conflicts arise.
The "Encoding" directory contains the ASP programs for creating plans for robots
as well as the program to combine the plans.
The "Benchmark for Development" directory contains the instances that were used for benchmarking during
the development of the program and the corresponding plans that solve these benchmarks.
The "Benchmark for Comparison" directory contains the benchmarks that were used to compare 
this solution with those of other groups working on the same problem. 
The "Documentation" and "Presentation" directory contain a paper and slides describing 
the project and the result.
